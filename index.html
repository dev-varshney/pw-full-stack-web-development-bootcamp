<p>Normally, an array is a collection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memory
    location.</p>

<p><b> java array</b> is <i>this is a italic</i><em>  dev varshney </em>an <u>dev varshney</u> which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The
        elements of an array are stored  a contiguous memory location. It is
        structure where we
        store similar elements. We <s>dev varshney</s>can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
        </p>
    <p>Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element
        is stored on 1st index and so on.
        </p>
    <p>Unlike C/C++, we can get the length of the array using the length member. In C/C++, we need
        to use the dad</p>
    <p>In Java, array is an object of a <sub>dev varshney</sub> generated class. <sup>dev vasrhney</sup>Java array inherits the Object class,
        and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. We can store primitive values or
        objects in an array in Java. <small>dev varshney</small>Like C/C++, we can also create sing dimentional or
        multidimentional arrays in Java.
        </p>
    <p>Moreover, Java provides the feature of anonymous arrays which is not available in C/C++.</p>
